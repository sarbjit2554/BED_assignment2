Scenario 1: Initializing Express Application
Breakpoint at: app.ts, Line 8 (const app = express();)

What’s happening?
The Express app is being created here. At this point, it’s just an empty app, ready to have routes and middleware attached.

Key Takeaway:
The app is initialized but nothing is set up yet. This is where the foundation for the app begins.

Scenario 2: Handling Employee Creation
Breakpoint at: employee.controller.ts, Line 5 (const employee = EmployeeService.createEmployee(req.body);)
What’s happening?
This line is where the createEmployee function is invoked, passing the request body (which contains the employee data) to the EmployeeService.createEmployee method to create a new employee in the system.
Key Takeaway:
The app is interacting with the service layer, and if the employee data is valid, a new employee is created. The response will include the created employee in JSON format, with a 201 Created status.

Scenario 3: Handling Branch Creation
Breakpoint at: branchRoutes.ts, Line 5 (const newBranch = BranchService.createBranch({ name, address, phone });)
What’s happening?
When a POST request is made to create a new branch, this line passes the branch data (name, address, phone) to the createBranch method in the BranchService. If the data is valid, it creates a new branch.
Key Takeaway:
This action adds a new branch to the system, returning the newly created branch in the response with a 201 Created status.
